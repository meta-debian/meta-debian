Subject: [PATCH] don't renameat2 please

commit 6ebc7d6bc8ab973d0ba949eeb363821811ce8dc5 upstream

So renameat2 now has a glibc wrapper in some recent glibc, which
means that mv can use it, and thus bypass all our clever testing,
and since we can't intercept the actual syscall (gnulib's implementation
apparently doesn't hit the glibc syscall() wrapper?), this results
in files being moved without pseudo knowing about them.

Implementing the semantics properly is Very Hard, but possibly we
can just fail politely for now.

We'll be back to this later.
