SUMMARY = "create dependencies in makefiles"
DESCRIPTION = "The makedepend program reads each sourcefile in sequence \
and parses it like a C-preprocessor, processing \
all #include, #define,  #undef, #ifdef, #ifndef, #endif, #if, #elif \
and #else directives so that it can correctly tell which #include, \
directives would be used in a compilation. Any #include, directives \
can reference files having other #include directives, and parsing will \
occur in these files as well."
