SUMMARY = "Audio sample rate conversion library"
DESCRIPTION = "\
libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion. \
libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion \
algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation \
(using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two \
algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are \
not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion \
is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided; \
SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a \
trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality \
