SUMMARY = "Xcomposite: X Composite extension library"

DESCRIPTION = "The composite extension provides three related \
mechanisms: per-hierarchy storage, automatic shadow update, and external \
parent.  In per-hierarchy storage, the rendering of an entire hierarchy \
of windows is redirected to off-screen storage.  In automatic shadow \
update, when a hierarchy is rendered off-screen, the X server provides \
an automatic mechanism for presenting those contents within the parent \
window.  In external parent, a mechanism for providing redirection of \
compositing transformations through a client."
