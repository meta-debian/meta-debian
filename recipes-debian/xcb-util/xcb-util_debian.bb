SUMMARY = "utility libraries for X C Binding -- atom, aux and event"
DESCRIPTION = "\
The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of \
libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension \
libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions \ 
and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the \
libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of \
the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib. \
