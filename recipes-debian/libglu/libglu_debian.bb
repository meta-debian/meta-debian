SUMMARY = "Mesa OpenGL utility library (GLU)"
DESCRIPTION = "GLU offers simple interfaces for building mipmaps; checking for the \
presence of extensions in the OpenGL (or other libraries which follow \
the same conventions for advertising extensions); drawing \
piecewise-linear curves, NURBS, quadrics and other primitives \
(including, but not limited to, teapots); tesselating surfaces; setting \
up projection matrices and unprojecting screen coordinates to world \
coordinates."
