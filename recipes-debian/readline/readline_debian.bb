SUMMARY = "Library for editing typed command lines"
DESCRIPTION = "The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by \
applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. \
Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes \
additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, \
to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion \
on previous commands."
