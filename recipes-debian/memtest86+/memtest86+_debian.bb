SUMMARY = "thorough real-mode memory tester"
DESCRIPTION = "Memtest86+ scans your RAM for errors.\n\
.\n\
This tester runs independently of any OS - it is run at computer\n\
boot-up, so that it can test *all* of your memory.  You may want to\n\
look at `memtester', which allows to test your memory within Linux,\n\
but this one won't be able to test your whole RAM.\n\
.\n\
It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel\n\
patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.\n\
.\n\
Memtest86+ is based on memtest86 3.0, and adds support for recent\n\
hardware, as well as a number of general-purpose improvements,\n\
including many patches to memtest86 available from various sources.\n\
.\n\
Both memtest86 and memtest86+ are being worked on in parallel."
