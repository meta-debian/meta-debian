DESCRIPTION = "\
Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well \
as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be \
a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and   \
evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client \
itself. The clients can be traditional applications, X servers \
(rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers. \
