SUMMARY = "Identify, read, write, erase, and verify BIOS/ROM/flash chips"
DESCRIPTION = "\
flashrom is a tool for identifying, reading, writing, verifying and erasing \
flash chips. It's often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware/optionROM \
images in-system using a supported mainboard, but it also supports flashing of \
network cards (NICs), SATA controller cards, and other external devices which \
can program flash chips. \
It supports a wide range of DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32/40/48, \
and BGA chips, which use various protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel \
flash, or SPI. \
The tool can be used to flash BIOS/firmware images for example -- be it \
proprietary BIOS images or coreboot (previously known as LinuxBIOS) images. \
It can also be used to read the current existing BIOS/firmware from a \
flash chip. \
