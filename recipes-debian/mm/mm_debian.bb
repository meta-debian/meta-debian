SUMMARY = " Shared memory library"
DESCRIPTION = "\
	OSSP mm is a two layer abstraction library which simplifies the use of \
	shared memory between forked (and therefore closely related) processes.\
	It hides all platform-dependent aspects of the process from the user \
	and provides a malloc(3)-style API."
