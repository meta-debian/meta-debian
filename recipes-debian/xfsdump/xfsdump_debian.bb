SUMMARY = "Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem"
DESCRIPTION = "\
	The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of    \
	other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.        \
	xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be \
	backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other\
	torage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the  \
	ump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended \
	ttributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are 'endian safe' and can  \
	hus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures \
	nd also between IRIX machines \
