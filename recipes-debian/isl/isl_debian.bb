SUMMARY = "manipulating sets and relations of integer points bounded by linear constraints"
DESCRIPTION = "isl is a library for manipulating sets and relations of integer points \
bounded by linear constraints. Supported operations on sets include \
intersection, union, set difference, emptiness check, convex hull, \
(integer) affine hull, integer projection, and computing the lexicographic \
minimum using parametric integer programming. It also includes an ILP solver \
based on generalized basis reduction."
