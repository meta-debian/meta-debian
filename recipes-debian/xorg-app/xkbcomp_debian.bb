SUMMARY = "A program to compile XKB keyboard description"

DESCRIPTION = "The xkbcomp keymap compiler converts a description of an \
XKB keymap into one of several output formats. The most common use for \
xkbcomp is to create a compiled keymap file (.xkm extension) which can \
be read directly by XKB-capable X servers or utilities."
