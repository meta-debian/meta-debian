What is meta-debian?
====================

meta-debian is a set of recipes (metadata) for the poky build system, which allows cross-building GNU/Linux images using Debian source packages.
By enabling meta-debian, you can cross-build a small GNU/Linux image with Debian sources for multiple architectures.

The main purpose of meta-debian is to provide reference Linux distribution for embedded systems satisfying the following needs.
* Long-term support
* Stability
* Wide embedded CPU support
* Customizability

Currently, the following software versions are supported in meta-debian.
* Source code: Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
* Build system: Yocto Project 2.0 (jethro)

Quick Start
===========

Install essential packages poky requires into your host system according to http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.0/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#intro-requirements

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install git tar python
$ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat
```

NOTE: The following three packages have version limitation
* git: 1.7.8 or greater
* tar: 1.24 or greater
* python: 2.7.3 or greater not including Python 3.x

Setup repositories.

```sh
$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
$ cd poky
$ git checkout jethro
$ git clone https://github.com/meta-debian/meta-debian.git
$ cd meta-debian
$ git checkout jethro
$ cd ../../
```

Setup build directory.

```sh
$ export TEMPLATECONF=meta-debian/conf
$ source ./poky/oe-init-build-env
```

You can change the target machine by setting `MACHINE` variable in `conf/local.conf` to one of the following machines.
* qemux86 (default)
* qemux86-64
* qemuarm
* qemuarm64
* qemuppc
* qemumips

For example, the target machine is set to QEMU ARM by adding the following difinition to `conf/local.conf`.
```
MACHINE = "qemuarm"
```

Now, the build system is ready.
Build Linux kernel and the minimal rootfs by the following command.
It takes a while to complete (more than 30 minutes).

```sh
$ bitbake core-image-minimal
```

Run the built Linux on QEMU.
Please replace `${MACHINE}` by the target machine you selected in the above step.

```sh
$ runqemu ${MACHINE} nographic
```

Only if `MACHINE` is `qemuarm`, the console should be set to the correct serial device.

```sh
$ runqemu qemuarm nographic bootparams="console=ttyAMA0"
```

After boot, you can login as `root` without password.

If you'd like to reduce the time of bitbake,
